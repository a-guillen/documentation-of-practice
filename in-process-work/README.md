I got inspired by the idea of the quarantine and being isolated from the outside. So, I decided to create a hypothetical scenario where holograms were real and how people would need to lean on this type of technology to cease their longing of going out. I did several sketches of what I wanted my artwork to be, until I decided to go with a small model of a room, with drawn people on the back, where the hologram -- which is going to be displayed through a reflection of my phone -- is the main focus of the piece.
